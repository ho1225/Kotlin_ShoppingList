Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability. Key components:

Model: Manages the data and business logic. In this app, it handles the shopping list items and interactions with the data source.
View: Represents the UI. It observes the ViewModel and updates the UI accordingly.
ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds the presentation logic, manages UI-related data, and communicates with the Model.
